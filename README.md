# Cicada_Challenge

This was a challenge where I had to use BeautifulSoup to parse through a passage on a blog link. <br/><br/>
There were 10 clues on the words that we had to find and we had to program our way through unless it wasn't required. <br/>
I was declared as the winner of this Cicada Challenge and was gifted a INR2.5k gift card on Amazon.
